Python API Challenge - WeatherPy & VacationPy
Overview
Welcome to the Python API Challenge repository! In this project, we aim to answer the age-old question: "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?" With the power of Python, APIs, and data visualization, we dive deep into the global weather patterns and its correlation with the equator. Additionally, we utilize weather data to identify ideal vacation destinations and nearby hotels.

Repository Structure
WeatherPy:

The main directory containing the Jupyter Notebook that handles the weather data collection and analysis. WeatherPy.ipynb is the primary script.
VacationPy:

This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook focused on vacation planning based on ideal weather conditions. VacationPy.ipynb is the main file.
Resources:

Contains datasets and other necessary files for the analysis.
.gitignore:

To ensure our API keys remain private and not pushed onto public repositories.
Key Components of Analysis
WeatherPy:
Retrieve weather data from over 500 cities worldwide.
Visualize the relationship between latitude and various weather attributes like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed.
Perform linear regression on each relationship, splitting the data between Northern and Southern Hemispheres.
VacationPy:
Use weather criteria to identify potential vacation destinations.
Visualize these destinations on a map.
Find nearby hotels using the Geoapify API.
Observations & Trends
Once you complete the analysis in the Jupyter Notebooks, consider adding a section here highlighting the major findings from the project. This section can include interesting relationships between weather attributes and latitude, as well as insights into potential vacation spots and their nearby hotels.
